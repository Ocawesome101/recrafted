Recrafted is ComputerCraft's CraftOS but with saner
API design.  It's also not licensed under the CCPL,
but rather the MIT license -- so you can freely use
Recrafted's  code in  other projects  without being
legally  bound  to  license  them  under  the CCPL.

All  APIs  are  implemented  as  described  on  the
CC: Tweaked wiki at https://tweaked.cc, with slight
modifications   to  fit  Recrafted's   API  design.
Certain modules  not  written  by  Dan200 have been
adapted from  CraftOS,   relicensed  under  the MIT
license with permission from their authors.

To use Recrafted, simply clone this repository into
.minecraft/saves/YOUR_WORLD/datapacks/recrafted and
reload the world.   You  can  also use the provided
installer, though it isn't quite as well supported.


Recrafted addresses several  major pain points many
have with  CraftOS.  It  has  native multithreading
support (not just parallel,  but a full scheduler);
changes  to  package.path   are  fully  persistent;
os.loadAPI has been  altogether discarded;  none of
the APIs provided by  the  system are inserted into
_G at  boot--instead  they  must  be  loaded  using
require(), as per Lua convention.   And, of course,
the CCPL is no longer in the picture.

discuss   it  in  greater  depth,  please  use  the
